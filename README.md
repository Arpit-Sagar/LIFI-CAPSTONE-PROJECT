# LIFI CAPSTONE PROJECT(2023)
Final Year Project
To implement automatic system of toll collection using LiFi(Light Fidelity), eliminating conventional methods and enhancing speed and accuracy in context of Toll Collection.

DATA transmission between LIFI Transmitter and Receiver on the principle of light detection,encoding and decoding of bits of data sent.
Basic idea of Blinking of Light LEDs at a faster rate,the receiver detects the blinking and decodes the data bits sent with the appropriate delay to succesfully display the message senti.e the vehicle number and toll gets deducted through payment portal.
Lifi Transmitter(Array of LED lights) installed on vehicle --> prototype of programmed headlight
Lifi Receiver on Toll gate detecting Vehicle number to map to existing database to deduct payment integration through WiFi Module ESP8266.

In this way,data transfer is implemented which ensures speed, security and efficiency.

This project is a combination of IoT,Programming and Software Development. 

This project is a prototype of the alternative optimal solution proposed for toll collection and implements unique design and structural technique.
