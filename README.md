# LIFI CAPSTONE PROJECT(2023)

To implement automatic system of toll collection using LiFi(Light Fidelity), eliminating conventional methods and enhancing speed and accuracy in context of Toll Collection.

DATA transmission between LIFI Transmitter and Receiver on the principle of light detection,encoding and decoding of bits of data sent.
Basic idea of Blinking of Light LEDs at a faster rate,the receiver detects the blinking and decodes the data bits sent with the appropriate delay to succesfully display the message sent.

In this way,data transfer is implemented which ensures speed, security and efficiency.

In this project, a vehicle installed with LiFi Transmitter transmits data(vehicle information i.e the unique vehicle number)through light and LiFi Receiver installed on Toll Gate receives it and detects the light and successful data communication leads to Vehicle information being displayed. This project is a combination of IoT,Programming and Software Development. 
Further integration with WiFi module to the software developed leads to a payment transaction from the user wallet that is mapped to the vehicle number owned by the user.
This project is a prototype of the alternative optimal solution proposed for toll collection and implements unique design and structural technique.
